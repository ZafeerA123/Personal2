## Comments on our game
One comment I heard during Night of the museum, was that someone said that the jumping should've been the space bar instead of the "w" button. Another comment that I heard was that our game should have something after the coin is touched, and another person said our game is so good it should be "phone compatible". Overall, I really enjoyed telling everyone how hour game was built using collaboration with 23 other people, and I really enjoyed Night of the museum for the other projects there as well.

I really liked this game because of all the features they added, including their shop system they added. Also how you had to add multiple things to gether to cook items, I really liked that. 


- Another thing I liked outside compsci was the photogrophy section, with all the beautiful scenery.
