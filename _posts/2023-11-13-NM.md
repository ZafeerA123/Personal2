## Comments on our game
One comment I heard during Night of the museum, was that someone said that the jumping should've been the space bar instead of the "w" button. Another comment that I heard was that our game should have something after the coin is touched, and another person said our game is so good it should be "phone compatible". Overall, I really enjoyed telling everyone how hour game was built using collaboration with 23 other people, and I really enjoyed Night of the museum for the other projects there as well.
